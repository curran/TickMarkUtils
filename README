A simple algorithm for computing the values to use for tick marks such that nice numbers are displayed. It chooses an interval which is {1 or 2 or 5}X10^n which most closely matches a desired number of tick marks between a given minimum and maximum value. This would be useful for anyone looking to draw tick marks on their plots.
